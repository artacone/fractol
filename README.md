# fractol

A first graphical project at School21. [Subject](fractol.pdf) has all the details.

`fractol` program can plot different fractals (Mandelbrot set, Julia set, Burning ship). It provides some controls over the image, e.g. zooming.

User can also switch between different colorings.

All code is written in correspondence with [Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette) codestyle.
